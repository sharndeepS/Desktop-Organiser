This Python script automatically organises files on your desktop by sorting them into folders based on their file extensions. 
The script scans the desktop for files, categorises them, and moves them to appropriate folders (e.g., "Images", "Documents", "Videos", etc.). 
If a fileâ€™s extension is not recognised, it is skipped.
